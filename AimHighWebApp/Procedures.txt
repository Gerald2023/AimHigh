//Publishing Database using Code First

1. Set PL as a startup project on from the solution explorer and as default project on package manager console
2. set connection string on "OnConfigure" on the entities command
3. Run the following commands on the package manager console:
	Add-Migration CreateDatabase
	Update-Database


Notes to myself:
When creating relationships between table on code first, make sure to create the independent entity first, then the dependent entity. example. Goals first before Milestones
